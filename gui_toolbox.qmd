In this map, the circles represent destinations, with the incursion site highlighted in hot pink.
The connections made by vessels between destinations are shown as clockwise arcs.
The size of circles and arcs are proportional to the level of pest movement.

# How it works

**How are we modelling invasion dynamics?**

We start an incursion at a chosen location and allow it to grow based on the species’ biology.
The pest population spawns and attach to vessels which are then carried throughout the seascape.
These pests can then be released into other destinations.
The pest populations can then die or grow to attach to other vessels and the process repeats.
In this way we can simulate the spread of marine pests.
o How are we modelling vessel movements?
We gathered vessel movement data for three maritime sectors: Commercial, Recreational, and Aquaculture.
We are modelling the average daily movement of hull area around New Zealand in a typical year.
We are not tracking individual vessels or individual organisms in this simulator.

**How are we modelling species?**

A pest in the model is represented by species-specific attributes, including: population growth rate, spawning window, fecundity, transport mode, and mortality rate.
We are modelling populations at destinations and how they are transferred among destinations through propagule pressure.
We then track the New Zealand wide population trajectory.
We do not include ecological interactions like competition or environmental tolerances such as temperature or salinity.

**How do we measure the potential spread of pest?**

We currently represent spread and incursion risk in three ways:

-   **Map View**: All spread dynamics, destinations, connections and management scenarios can be visualised on the interactive map of New Zealand.
    In this map, we show the destination level propagule pressure and how it moves through the seascape.

-   **Destination Status**: We track the spread of the pest through the number of destinations over time.
    We show the total number of destinations in which the pest is: a) absent, b) introduced but not yet established and c) established and growing.
    Destination status is plotted through time.

-   **Potential Propagule Pressure** (PPP): We calculate the total level of propagule pressure introduced across New Zealand’s seascape, partitioned by maritime sectors: Commercial, Recreational, and Aquaculture.

We use these three representations of potential spread to compare and contrast management scenarios (BAU, CULL, HULL) and starting locations.

# How pest spread {orientation="columns"}

Biological invasions are a complex interaction between wildlife and human activities that move species around.
When a species is moved outside of its historical native range, it can become a pest in its new environment and damage ecological, environmental, social, and cultural values.
As a result, it’s important to understand how the invasion process occurs and how to minimize inadvertent and unwanted movements of plants and animals.

The invasion process can be broken down into five steps, and this can often involve ships and boats in marine ecosystems

**Entrainment**: At a source location (starting point), marine plants and animals can attach to vessel hulls, or equipment, or become entrained in ballast or bilge water.
This begins a process of human-assisted movement.

**Transport**: In many cases, marine species are resilient enough to hang on or survive transport conditions.
This can include short coastal transits or longer voyages in the open ocean.
It can also include being on the outside of a vessel (as biofouling) or inside a vessel (in ballast water, for example).
If organisms can survive a voyage or multiple voyages, they will arrive at new destinations with the vessel.

**Introduction**: At some point during a vessels stay in a port, marina, or anchorage, a species may have the opportunity to jump off, reproduce, or be actively discharged into the new environment at the destination.
There are several cases when changes in water temperature, salinity or other factor might trigger a species to spawn or release propagules.
The newly released individuals may then become a starting point for a newly established population (a new invasion at that location).

**Establishment**: Newly arrived individuals must survive, grow, and reproduce in their new environment.
Once new generations of the species have been able to take hold, the species is considered established as it can now remain in the new environment without needing new individuals to arrive to keep the population going.

**Spread**: Once established, a pest population can spread by moving itself, with coastal currents, or by attaching to other vessels and continuing the invasion process.
In this way, a marine species can increase its new non-native range (its footprint) around the seascape.

**MarPEST** is designed to help us understand the trajectory of marine invasions in New Zealand.
Simulations can provide insights into important components of vessel networks and locations that contribute to invasive spread.
It may also inform biosecurity decisions regarding how to reduce spread rates or develop strategies to control and manage invasive species to reduce their impacts.
