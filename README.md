# Biosecurity ToolbBox Graphical User Interface

This repository is for a Graphical User Interface ([GUI](https://cawthron.shinyapps.io/gui_toolbox/)) designed to visualise the outputs of a dynamic network model simulating the connectivity between New Zealand's ports following a Mediterranean fanworm, *Sabella spallanzanii*, incursion.

This research was conducted as part of the [Marine Biosecurity ToolBox](https://www.biosecurity-toolbox.org.nz/) programme, which is funded by the New Zealand Ministry for Business, Innovation and Employment research grant C01X1511.
